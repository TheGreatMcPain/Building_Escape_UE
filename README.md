# Building_Escape

## Migrated to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/TheGreatMcPain/Building_Escape_UE) due to Github's LFS limits.

A simple game which the player "grabs" an object and uses it to trigger a "pressure plate" to open a door.

(From Gamedev.tv's UnrealEngine C++ course on Udemy.)

UnrealEngine version 4.26.x
